Is a computer architecture that utilizes:
- **Separated [[Memory]] for programs ([[Instruction]]s) and data ([[Operand]]s)**
- Code and data can be stored on different memory types.
- Can use **different size of cells** in memory, such as 8 bits for data and 18 bits for instructions.
- Allows to load instruction and data in one tick.
- Is quicker then [[Von Neuman Architecture]].
