Is a computer architecture that utilizes:
- **Shared [[Memory]] for both data and programs** (instructions).
- **Flexibility** for program (application) manipulation.
- Allows for **self-modifying** code.
- [[Instruction]]s and [[Operand]]s need to be loaded from [[Memory]] in sequence and the bus is usually a bottleneck. 
- Is slower then [[Harvard Architecture]].
- Easier implementation as there is no need to distinguish between instruction and data reading.
