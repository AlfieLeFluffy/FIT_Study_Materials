Polling (Programmed Handling) is a less efficient, but less complex way of handling peripheral devices then [[Interrupt]]s. The currently running program periodically asks (makes queries) in a loop (most probably [[While]]) the peripheral devices if a change occurred or for their current state. This is inefficient due to the process possibly repeatably asking for changes where non may have taken place, eating way at resources.
