**Reduced instruction set** that unlike [[Complete Instruction Set Computing (CISC)|CISC]] implements a small amount of [[Instruction]]s, most often only elementary (atomic) operations that can be strung together to mimic complex instructions.
## Common Properties
- Most common instructions are LOAD and STORE.
- All instruction have the same length and take only one cycle (tick) to run.
- Uses a greater number of registers.
- Most of the chip is dominated by registers.
- Processors implementing RISC have a lower energy requirements (are more efficient) and are becoming more popular.
## Examples
Apple Silicon is an example of RISC processors.
