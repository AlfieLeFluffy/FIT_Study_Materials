**Complete Instruction Set Computing** is a complex [[Instruction]] set.
## Common Properties
- Many instruction types with many variants and address modes, where one instruction can combine multiple elementary (atomic) operations.
- Typical memory-to-memory instructions, where choosing and storing the operands in memory is part of the instruction.
- Instructions do not have the same length which makes them harder to decode.
- Carrying out one instruction might take multiple cycles (ticks).
- Does not use many registers, sometimes uses only an accumulator.
- Most of the chip is dominated by logic to carry out the implementation of instructions.
## Examples
CISC processors are most commonly found in Intel products.
