Is an interconnectivity component that allows for communication between more then one sources of data and receivers of data. It is responsible for data transfers and control instructions between devices.
## Components
A bus can be defined as:
- **Communication Interface** - A set of conductors, their meanings and electrical characteristics.
- **Communication Protocol** - It specifically defines how the communication between two devices will be carried out. 
- **Transaction (Cycle)** - A sequence of steps that are necessary to realize a specific function.

## Types of Communication
**By synchronisty:**

![[Synchronisty]]

**By amount of data transferred at ones:**

![[Serial Interface]]

![[Parallel Interface]]

**By communication direction:**

![[Full-Duplex]]

![[Half-Duplex]]

![[Simplex]]

**By acknowledgment:**
- Has some sort of a mechanism for a handshake confirmation of data being received.
- Does not know if the data was received.
## Types of Buses
- **Serial or Parallel - explained above
- **Internal or External**
- **Shared or Dedicated** - If the communication channels share conductors or not.
## Communication Channels
There are three common communication channels in use:
- **Address**
- **Data**
- **Control**
## Parameters
- **Bus Speed** - is defined by the **bus width**, **technology** (serial/parallel) and **cycle rate**
- **Bandwidth** - is defined as **bus speed** * **bus width**
