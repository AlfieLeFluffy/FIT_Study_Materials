A demultiplexor is a [[Combination Circuit]] that can turn **N+1** inputs into **2<sup>N</sup>** inputs and is the opposite version of a [[Multiplexor]]. 
	Essentially can take 3 input, one function input and two control inputs and can turn it into one of 4 function outputs.

Demultiplexor can be created with logic gates and can be configured in many ways and technically do not have a limit to their size.
