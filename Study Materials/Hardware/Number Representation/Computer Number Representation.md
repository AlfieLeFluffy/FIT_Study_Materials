Numbers are in computers represented as values of binary bits, so in a [[Binary System]]. Unlike in the real world, numbers in computers are restricted by the amounts of bits, that are reserved for a given number. Commonly are in use three base bits sizes that can be either with a sign or without it:
- **Short Integer** - 16 bits
- **Integer** - 32 bits
- **Long Integer** - 64 bits
These formats are [[Whole Number Representation]], but there can also be [[Decimal Number Representation]].
