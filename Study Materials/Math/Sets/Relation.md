Relation (tuple) in mathematics is a any relation between a group of elements of one or more [[Set]]s. By the amount of elements in the relations we divide relations into:
- **Unary** 
- **Binary**
- **Ternary**
- **N-nary**
A relation between sets **A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>k</sub>** where **k ∈ N** (natural numbers) is any subset of the Cartesian multiplication of **R ⊆ A<sub>1</sub> * A<sub>2</sub> * ... * A<sub>k</sub>**. If  **A<sub>1</sub> =  A<sub>2</sub> = ... = A<sub>k</sub> = A** then we are talking bout a **k-nary** relation **R** over **A**.
## Cartesian Multiplication (Product)
Cartesian multiplication of sets **X** and **Y** creates an ordered set of doubles, in which the first element is from set **X** and the second element is from set **Y**. This can for example create a relation set between these two sets such as set `A = {1,2,3}` and `B = {a, b, c}` resulting in relation **R** `A * B = R {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c), (3, a), (3, b), (3, c)}`.
## Unary Relation
Only one element is present in the relation. This can be for example:
- Relation: **is positive number**
- Relation: **is true statement**
## Binary Relation
Binary relation have two elements from a set or sets. This relation **R** over sets **A** and **B** are any subset of the relation set that is the result of Cartesian multiplication of these sets. 
### Notation
- We can signify a relation as **\[a, b\]** where **a** and **b** are elements of one or two sets.
- Another way to signify this is by **(aRb)**, but this is less used.
- If **A = B** then we can say that the relation is over the set **A**.
- Set **A** is also called a **definition field** of relation **R**.
- Set **B** is also called a **value field** of relation **R**.
### Properties
Relations have several properties and state they can have:
- **Reflexive** - A relation is reflexive if all for all elements **x** that belong into the **X** there exists a relation **\[x, x\]**. This means that all elements are in a relation with themselves. An empty set is also reflexive, but an empty relation over an not empty set is not reflexive.
- **Transitive** - A relation that contains relations **\[a, b\]** and **\[b, c\]** must also contain a relation **\[a, c\]**. An empty set is also transitive.
- **Symmetrical** - A relation is symmetrical if for all relations **\[a, b\]** also exists a relation **\[b, a\]**. An empty set is also symmetrical.
- **Asymmetrical** - A relation is asymmetrical (strong) if it is at the same time **antisymmetrical** and **ireflexive** (does not contain any reflexive traits).
- **Antisymmetrical** - A relation is antisymmetrical (weak) if in the relation does not happen that these two relation **\[a, b\]** and **\[b, a\]** are present at the same time
### Known Binary Relations
- **Ekvivalence** is a relation that is reflexive, symmetrical and transitive. It is for example parallel lines, equal numbers, etc.
- **Ordering** is a relation that is reflexive, slightly antisymmetrical and transitive. This can be for example greater then or equal, lesser then or equal, subset, etc.
- **Sharp Ordering** is irreflexive, asymmetrical and transitive. It can be greate then, lesser then, is subset that is not the original set.
## Ternary Relation
Ternary relations are relations of three elements that can be from one or more sets. These relations **R** over sets **A, B and C** are any subset of the relation set that is the result of Cartesian multiplication of these sets. 
### Algebra
A set over which are defined some **operations** and the set is closed against these operations. This can for example be a relation **(1, +, 2)**, which results in **3** which is still part of set **R** (real numbers).
### Congruence
Congruence is **equivalence** (reflexive, symmetrical, transitive relation) over an **algebra** (set of closed operations). This can be for example a set of **residual classes**.
## Relation Operations
Most of these operations are defined for or commonly work for **binary relations**. 
### Inverse
An inverse relation **R<sup>-1</sup>** to a relation **R** is when the order of elements in each relation is switched around so for relation R = {(1, a), (2, b)} the inverse relation is R<sup>-1</sup>= { (a, 1), (b, 2) }. 
### Relation Closure
Operation in which we are trying to finish a given relation to a specific property:
- **Transitive** R<sup>+</sup> looks at elements of the relation and tries to complete it so all members are transitive.
- **Reflexive** completes all elements of relation so each element of the set has a reflexive relation in the set of relations.
- **Symmetrical** completes all elements of relation so each element of the set of relations has its symmetrical counterpart.
