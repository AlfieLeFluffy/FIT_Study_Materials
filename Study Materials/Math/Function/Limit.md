A limit is a mathematical construct that signifies that a values in a given function approaches **arbitrarily close** to some point. This point is then called a **limit**. Function **f(x)** has in a point **p** a limit **L** if for an **arbitrarily selected space** around point **L** exists surrounding space of point **p** in a way that for all real numbers **x != p** of this surrounding space there does exist values of function **f(x)** of the chosen space of point **L**. A function can have **only one limit at one point**. Function **f(x)** is continuous in point **p** only if for limit in point **p** applies **f(x) = f(p)**.
