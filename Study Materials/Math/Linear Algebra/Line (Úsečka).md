It is a basic geometrical entity defined by to points (ends). It is for example used in [[Vector Graphics]].

- **General equation**: Ax + By + C = 0, where A = (y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>),  B = (x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>). Beware that vector \[A,B\] is its normal vector.
- **Parametric equation**: x = x<sub>1</sub> + tA, y = y<sub>1</sub> + tB, where t Îµ <0,1> and A = (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>), B = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) and vector \[A,B\] is its direction vector.
- **Directive equation**: y = kx + q, where k = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)
