## Silicon, physics and types
Silicon (Si) is a semiconductor with 4 electrons in the valence shell out of 8 and its valence shell is very close to the conductive band (a border where bound electrons can become free electrons and conduct electric current).

This property allows silicon to on the border between a conductive and a non-conductive material, hence it is a semi-conductive material and allows for complex interactions in electronics.

In a pure silicon material (a group of only silicon atoms) neighbouring silicon atoms share their electrons in the valence shell making the atoms stable.

A way to change this is to dope (add different atoms into the mix) that change the amount of electrons that the silicon bonds with. If we would to dope the silicon with phosphor, which has five electrons in the valence shell, which when then bonded with silicon create one free electron without that is not locked into any bond and thus creates a negative charge over the material, hence this is called a N-type (negative) silicon.

If we were to dope the silicon with the opposite, an atom with less then 4 atoms in the valence shell then it would create a hole, a spot where an electron is expected, but is missing, thus creating a positive charge as the material wants to fill that hole. This is called a P-type silicon.
