CMOS is a type of [[MOSFET]] that are used for creation of logic circuits. Their main advantage is low power demand (high efficacy) and a resistance against noise. 

## Types
There are two types of CMOS components; a **PMOS** and a **NMOS**.
- **PMOS** is open when the Gate is low voltage (0V) and is using hole conductivity. Source is connected to the positive pole and Drain is connected to the negative pole. Source and Drain electrodes are P-type and Substrate is N-type. There is lower voltage on Source then Drain. ![[PMOS]]
- **NMOS** is open when the Gate is high voltage (1V) and is using electron conductivity. Source is connected to the negative pole and Drain is connected to the positive pole. Source and Drain electrodes are N-type and Substrate is P-type. There is higher voltage on Source then Drain. ![[NMOS]]
