Diodes and other semiconductor electronic parts use PN junction to function using the properties of [[Semiconductor]] and doping.
## PN Junction
A PN junction is created when a P-type and N-type silicon are put next to each other (pushed against each other, fused). This creates a barrier on the border between these materials. Some of the N-type free electrons travel over to the P-type section, effectively switching polarities on the border.

The main property of this junction is that in only allows the current to flow in one direction (unless overwhelmed, burned through with enough current). This property is the result of electrons flowing from the negative pole (electron current flow), filing the holes in the N-type side, until they hit the P-type side where they can connect with the free electrons of the P-type, creating a connection and letting the flow continue. If the negative pole would be connected to the P-type side, the free electrons would not have anywhere to go as there are already free electrons in the P-type and thus stopping the current and actually widening the PN junction gap through voltage. Of course if enough voltage would be brought to the P-type side then it would be powerful enough to break through the PN junction, irreversibly damaging it.

## Diodes
We can use this PN junction to create an electrical part that uses this ability to stop and direct current through electrical circuits, a diode. A diode uses a PN junction with it anode connected to the P-type side and cathode to the N-type side, with the junction encased in resin to protect the insides.

## Important Notes
- When adding a diode into a circuit do not forget to add a resistor as well to lower the voltage in order to not burn out the diode.
