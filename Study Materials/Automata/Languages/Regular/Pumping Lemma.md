Is a mechanism by which it can be proved that a [[Language|language]] is **NOT** [[Regular Language|regular]], so it cannot prove that one is. If **L** is a regular language, then exists **k>=1** such that:
- if **z ∈ L** then exists **u, v, w: z = uvw**
- **v != ε*
* **|uv| <= k**
* for each **m>=0**, **uv^mw ∈ L**
